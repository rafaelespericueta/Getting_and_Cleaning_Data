<p>The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: </p>

<p>Here are the data for the project: </p>

<h3>Reading in the Data</h3>

<p>After unzipping the data file, we first read in the file <em>features.txt</em>, to modify these original feature names to use in naming our data frame columns. We extracted only those names containing <em>mean</em> or <em>std</em> as substrings. Further we then made sure the names were valid ones using the <em>make.names</em> command. That command replaces illegal characters with dots, so next we removed any pairs of dots, so that for example <em>cat&hellip;V&hellip;2</em> would become <em>cat.V.2</em>. We also noted by reading the file <em>features_info.txt</em> that features beginning with a &ldquo;t&rdquo; represented time series data, and features beginning with a &ldquo;f&rdquo; were FFT transformed features (transformed to the frequency domain).  So we
replaced the initial &ldquo;t&rdquo; by &ldquo;Time.&rdquo;, and an initial &ldquo;f&rdquo; was replaced by &ldquo;Freq.&rdquo; for improved readability.</p>

<p>Next we read in the file containing the subject codes <em>subject_train.txt</em>, the training data <em>X_train.txt</em>, and the training labels <em>&ldquo;y_train.txt&rdquo;</em>, and then subsetted the training data to only include the columns containing <em>mean</em>
or <em>&ldquo;std&rdquo;</em>. The test data was similarly read in (files: <em>subject_test.txt</em>, <em>X_test.txt</em>, and <em>y_test.txt</em>) and subsetted as before.</p>

<h3>Data Munging</h3>

<p>The training labels and test labels were appended to the traning and test data frames as final columns using <em>cbind</em>, and then the training and test data frames were combined using <em>rbind</em> into one data frame, <em>alldat</em>. Then the activity codes were tranformed from numeric to plain English for easier readability.</p>

<p>At this point we found the data to be complete, with no NA&#39;s present. However, we did discover a couple of columns with different names but containing the same data. It turned out that the columns <em>Time.BodyAccMag.mean</em> and <em>Time.GravityAccMag.mean</em> contained the same data, so we deleted the column <em>Time.BodyAccMag.mean</em>.  Also the column
<em>Time.BodyAccMag.std</em> and <em>Time.GravityAccMag.std</em> contained the same data, so we deleted the column <em>Time.BodyAccMag.std</em>.  We then checked for duplicate rows, but found none.</p>

<h3>Output our 1st  Tidy Data File</h3>

<p>Our tidy data frame, <em>alldat</em>, was then written to the file, <em>tidy_data.txt</em>, using the command:  </p>

<pre><code>write.table(alldat, &quot;tidy_data.txt&quot;, sep=&quot;\t&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>To read this file, use the command:</p>

<pre><code>td &lt;- read.table(&quot;tidy_data.txt&quot;, sep=&quot;\t&quot;)
</code></pre>

<h3>Create a Data Frame of Sums of Measurements for each Combination of Subject and Activity</h3>

<p>From the data frame <em>alldat</em>, we created a new data frame <em>alldat.mean</em> containing the means for each choice of a subject and an activity. Each subject had several measurements for each activity, which were averaged, so we ended up with a data frame with 6 rows for each subject (corresponding to the 6 activities, <em>Walking</em>, <em>Walking_upstairs</em>, <em>Walking_downstairs</em>, <em>Sitting</em>, <em>Standing</em>, <em>Laying</em>). The column names were left as before, though in the new data frame <em>alldat.mean</em>, the values are the <em>means</em> of those measurements. Appending the designation &ldquo;Mean&rdquo; to each name would have made the feature names a bit cumbersome.</p>

<h3>Output our 2nd Tidy Data File (of means)</h3>

<p>Finally we output our second tidy data frame, <em>alldat.mean</em>, to the file <em>tidy_data_mean.txt</em>, using the command:</p>

<pre><code>write.table(alldat.mean, &quot;tidy_data_means.txt&quot;, sep=&quot;\t&quot;, row.names=FALSE)
</code></pre>

<p>Read this file using the command:</p>

<pre><code>td &lt;- read.table(&quot;tidy_data_means.txt&quot;, header = TRUE, sep=&quot;\t&quot;)
</code></pre>
